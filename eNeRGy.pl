@template = ("The Life Path is the sum of the birth date. This number represents who you are at birth and the native traits that you will carry with you through life. The most important number that will be discussed here is your Life Path number. The Life Path describes the nature of this journey through life.", "A number derived from all of the letters in your full birth name make up what is called the Expression or Destiny number. Although this number is called both of these names, throughout this report it will be referred to as the Expression number. This is the number that describes the talents and attitudes at your disposal in this lifetime, if you choose to develop and use them. This is sometimes referred to as your potential or destiny. Living up to attributes of this number may not be easy, but it is your goal in the here and now.  It is your life's purpose, spiritual mission, and your field of opportunity.  Unlike the Life Path number which reads as you are, the Expression number more correctly reads as you MUST.", "The Soul Urge or as it is sometimes called, the heart's desire, is an important core influence in numerology. This means your inner craving, likes and dislikes. This number denotes what you value most regardless of Life Path (what you are from birth) and expression (what you will become in life).", "A secret dream, your inner desires, or maybe even fantasies. As a modifier, this aspect of your chart may be considered less important than many of the others because often these remote and deep-seated dreams are never realized. Sometimes, however, when this number has a relationship to another core number, the dream can come true. Strangely, this number is also associated with your personality or how people see you on first meetings. This number may be so strong in your subconscious that you even project the trait as a personality mask.", "The birthday is a supporting influence added to the Life Path.  Think of it as a modifier to the Life Path. These are traits that you brought into this life much as with the more important and dominating traits shown by the Life Path.", "The life path has been discussed in very elementary details previously, and the life path period is an addition to this reading that should be taken into account. If we live long enough, we will experience three life path periods. As you progress into this page, think of the readings in terms of a modification or enhancement personalizing the life path reading. These readings do not replace the life path reading, but merely fine tune and customize it to the individual. Because life path periods can vary so widely, the life path we are on becomes complex and motley. Here the info for each period contains early, productive, and later year info for the respective period number. Read the early years for period one, the productive years for period 2, and the later years for period 3.", "Lets face it.  Life is not a bed of roses.  There are hurdles to get over and mountains to climb.  In numerology, the roadblock faced in life is called the challenge.  The Challenge is a weak point in our Life Path. It is the weak link in the chain of life which must be overcome for us to grow and develop properly. We learn by meeting the challenge, and dealing with it effectively. The nature of the challenge is shown in the Life Path.\n\nThe numbers behind the final challenge will each be a potential problem during half of the life. The first sub challenge during the first part of the life, and the second sub challenge during the second half of the life. The Final Challenge is a potential weakness and problem throughout the entire life.", "Now we\'ll look at your name with respect to the number of times that the same number repeats, or when certain numbers fail to be represented in your name. The repetition of numbers may show special talents that you possess. The absence of numbers suggests an issue relating to the nature of the number. Some numerologists suggest that the absence of a number reflects a karmic debt carried over from a previous lifetime. The norm in distribution of numbers in the name is somewhat hazy because some names are very short and others are very long. The average name has 15 to 19 letters in it. If this is you, then the following averages should work for you:\n\nThe number:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nAverage occurrence is:\n3 1 2 1 4 2 1 1 3\n\nIf your name is significantly longer or shorter than 15-19 letters, you must make adjustments accordingly.\n\nBe aware that if a missing or less than average number is represented in the subject's core numbers (the Life Path, Expression, or Soul Urge), the karmic deficiency is diminished, if not completely eliminated. For example, if an individual did not have the number 5 in her name, but her Life Path number was 5, she would have little difficulty handling the deficiency shown by the absence of the number.", "The Essences are numeric values for the years of your life. Below should be a table with the length you indicated when you entered your data. Below that, you will find information for each of the Essence values. For any given year in the chart, you can use the eNeRGy Oracle script to determine what the personal year value for that year is, thus learning which Essence years are also personal years.", "Pinnacle Phases\nWe are all inherently subject to major changes in our lives just as surely as we are subject to death and taxes. Numerology attempts to project major life changes and calls these monumental turns in the road pinnacles. If it weren't for these big transformations in life, the highly successful would become apathetic, and those struggling would soon feel totally hopeless. Pinnacle in our live give us the necessary change of pace and direction that is stimulating and hopeful. Pinnacles show the direction that progress will lead us.\n\nA pinnacle is an experience occurring over a specific time in our life. These pinnacle periods have been likened to the four seasons. The first pinnacle is in the spring of life. The second covering years of family raising and responsibility represents summer. The third covering middle-age and growing maturity of judgment represents the autumn of life, and the forth, consolidating the experiences of life, is represented by winter.", "Numerology is the study of numbers, and the occult manner in which they reflect certain aptitudes and character tendencies, as an integral part of the cosmic plan. Each letter has a numeric value that provides a related cosmic vibration. The sum of the numbers in your birth date and the sum of value derived from the letters in the name provide an interrelation of vibrations. These numbers show a great deal about character, purpose in life, what motivates, and where talents may lie. Experts in numerology use the numbers to determine the best time for major moves and activities in life. Numerology is used to decide when to invest, when to marry, when to travel, when to change jobs, or relocate. I'm not claiming that this report is going to make an expert of you so that all these questions can be answered, but we can at least get you on the way. The first question I asked when numerology was exposed to me was why does it work. The second question was how does it work. Well, if we could answer these questions it wouldn't be an occult study, would it? Is it a God force? Do numbers have vibrations or something like that? Who knows? Just be objective and give it a try.\n\nPythagoras, the Greek mathematician who live from 569-470 B.C., is said by many to be the originator of much of what we call numerology today. The actual origins of numerology predate Pythagoras, the most popular being the very old Hebrew Kabbala. In the twentieth century, the old science seemed to magically reappear in the form of a series of books published from 1911-1917 by L. Dow Balliett and it was helped along in the 30s by Florence Campbell, and within the next few decades a wealth of literature was available to the public. Indeed, if you look at the past 90 years, it would seem that the science has moved very rapidly. But perhaps all of this was known at a much earlier time, and it was just hiding from us for a while.", "The word expression used here really means activity or how we act. This determination of expression is a product of birth name; the full birth name, but in this exercise we are going to consider each and every letter. We will build a table and each letter will have its spot.\n\nEach letter of the alphabet is placed in one of four planes of expression or temperament: Mental, Physical, Emotional or Intuitive. To get a grasp of these, you should think of mental letters a leading to qualities that rely heavily on the mind, on reasoning, and using facts to make decisions; physical plane letters suggests the systemic behavior of the disciplined, the practical, the builder, using energies on the here and now; emotional plane letters develop qualities of imagination, originality and inspiration, guided by emotions and sentiment; finally, intuitive plane letter promote inspiration, idea development, spiritual inclination, and what you might call that sixth sense. I hope I haven't made any of these sound more or less important than the others. They aren't.\n\nTo complicate things just a bit more, these four groups are subdivided once again to further define expression. These divisions within the planes of expression show the letters denoting a tendency towards being inspired/creative, or being mutable/adaptive, or being well grounded/balanced.");

%lifepath = (1, "The Life Path 1 drive in this life is characterized by individualist desires, independence, and the need for personal attainment. The purpose to be fulfilled on this Life Path is that of becoming independent. This is a two part learning process; first, you must learn to stand on your own two feet and learn not to depend on others. After you are indeed free and independent, you must learn to be a leader. Many of our Generals, corporate leaders, and political leaders are men and women having the Life Path number 1. The 1 always has the potential for greatness as a leader, but they may fail as a follower. Many 1's spend most of their lives shaking off their dependent side. When this happens, there is little time left for enjoying the rewards to be gained through independence. The individual with Life Path 1 has to overcome an environment in which it is very easy to be dependent, and difficult to be independent.\n\nA person with positive 1 traits abounds in creative inspiration, and possesses the enthusiasm and drive to accomplish a great deal. Your drive and potential for action comes directly from the enormous depth of strength you have. This is both the physical and inner varieties of strength. With this strength comes utter determination and the capability to lead. As a natural leader you have a flair for taking charge of any situation. Highly original, you may have talents as an inventor or innovator of some sort. In any work that you choose, your independent attitude can show through. You have very strong personal needs and desires, and you feel it is always necessary to follow your own convictions. You are ambitious, and either understand or must learn the need for aggressive action to promote yourself. Although you may hide the fact for social reasons, you are highly self-centered and demand to have your way in most circumstances.", 2, "The positive attributes of the number 2 Life Path produces extremely sensitive people who generally have the most delicate ability to be balanced and fair. You clearly see the full spectrum of viewpoints in any argument or situation, and because of this people may seek you out to be a mediator. In this role you are able to settle disputes with the most unbiased flair. There is sincere concern for others; you think the best of people, and want the best for them. You are totally honest and open in thought, word and deed. You are apt to excel in any for of group activity where your expertise in handling and blending people can be used effectively. Manners and tact mark your way with others at all times, and you are not one to dominate a group or situation. You are the master of compromise and of maintaining harmony in your environment, never stooping to aggravate or argue. In many ways, you are a creature of habit and routine, and you like to your path and pattern well worn and familiar. A natural collector, you rarely dispose of anything that may have a shred of value.\n\nThe negative side of the 2 is hardly a problem. The biggest obstacle and difficulty you may face is that of passivity and a state of apathy and lethargy. The negative 2 can be very pessimistic and accomplishes very little. Needless to say, the negative 2 doesn't belong in the business world and even the more positive individual with the 2 Life Path may prefer a more amiable and less competitive environment.", 3, "The number 3 Life Path is one that emphasizes expression, sociability, and creativity as the lesson to be learned in this life. Here we are apt to find the entertainers of the world, bright, effervescent, sparkling people with very optimistic attitudes. A truly gifted 3 possesses the most exceptional creative skills, normally in the verbal realm, writing, speaking, acting, or similar endeavors. The lesson to be learned with a 3 life path is that of achievement through expression. The bright side of this path stresses harmony, beauty and pleasures; of sharing your creative talents with the world. Capturing your capability in creative self-expression is the highest level of attainment for this life path. The characteristics of the 3 are warmth and friendliness, a good conversationalist, social and open. A good conversationalist both from the standpoint of being a delight to listen to, but even more importantly, one who has the ability to listen to others. Accordingly, the life path 3 produces individuals who are always a welcome addition to any social situation and know how to make others feel at home. The creative imagination is present, if sometimes latent, as the 3 may not be moved to develop his talent. The approach to life tends to be exceedingly positive, however, and your disposition is almost surely sunny and open-hearted. You effectively cope with all of the many setbacks that occur in life and readily bounce back for more. It is usually easy for you to deal with problems because you can freely admit the existence of problems without letting them get you down. You have good manners and seem to be very conscious of other people's feelings and emotions. Life is generally lived to the fullest, often without much worry about tomorrow. You are not very good at handling money because of a general lack of concern about it. You spend it when you have it and don't when you don't.\nOn the negative side, a 3 may be so delighted with the joy of living that the life becomes frivolous and superficial. You may scatter your abilities and express little sense of purpose. The 3 can be an enigma, for no apparent reason you may become moody and tend to retreat. Escapist tendencies are not uncommon with the 3 life path, and you find it very hard to settle into one place or one position. Guard against being critical of others, impatient, intolerant, or overly optimistic.\n\nTypically, the life path 3 gives an above-average ability in some art form. This can encompass painting, interior decorating, landscaping, crafts, writing, music, or the stage, or all of the above. You are apt to be a happy, inspired person, constantly seeking the stimuli of similar people. Your exuberant nature can take you far, especially if you are ever able to focus your energies and talents.", 4, "The Life Path 4 produces the most trustworthy, practical, and down-to-earth of individuals; the cornerstone members of society. The goal of this life path is learning to take orders and to carry them out with dedication and perseverance. You always demand as much from yourself as you do from others, and sometimes a lot more. You have the kind of will power that is often mistaken for sheer stubbornness. Once a decision is made, it will be followed through to the conclusion, right, wrong, or indifferent; you are very set in your ways and determined to handle things the way you are so certain that they should be handled. Your tenacity of purpose and ability to get the job done borders on obsession.\nYou are an excellent organizer and planner because of your innate ability to view things in a very common sense and practical way. You are a wonderful manager with a great sense of how to get the job done.\n\nLoyal and devoted, you make the best of your marriage, and you are a dependable business partner. Friends may be few in number, but you are very close to them and once friendships are made, they often last a lifetime. The number 4 is solidly associated with the element of earth from which it gains it strength and utter sense of reality. You are one of the most dependable people you know. If patience and determination can ever win, you are sure to achieve great success in life.\n\nThe negative side of the 4 can prove dogmatic to an excess, narrow-minded, and repressive. A lot of skin-deep people turn you off, and you lack the tact to keep your feelings from being totally clear to all around. Additionally, the negative 4 has a bad tendency to get too caught up in the daily routine of affairs and often misses the big picture and major opportunities that come along once in a while.", 5, "A Life Path 5 person is usually very versatile, adventurous, and progressive. With a 5 life path, you are one of those people who is always striving to find answers to the many questions that life poses. You want to be totally unrestrained, as this is the sign of freedom and independence. You abhor routine and boring work, and you are not very good at staying with everyday tasks that must be finished on time. You are, however, a good communicator, and you know how to motivate people around you, perhaps inclining you to be a teacher of some sort. A love of adventure may dominate your life. This may take the form of mental or physical manifestation, but in either case, you thrill to the chance for exploration and blazing new trails. You are apt to be multi-talented, but just as likely to suffer from some lack of direction, and there is often some confusion surrounding your ambition.\nOn the average, the number 5 personality is rather happy-go-lucky; living for today, and not worrying too much about tomorrow. It is important for you to mix with people of a like mind, and try to avoid those that are too serious and demanding. It is also important for you to find a job that provides thought-provoking tasks rather than routine and redundant responsibilities. You do best dealing with people, but the important thing is that you have the freedom to express yourself at all times. You have an innate ability to think through complex matters and analize them quickly, but then be off to something new.\n\nIn the most negative application or use of the 5 energies, you could become very irresponsible in tasks and decisions concerning your home and business life. The total pursuit of sensation and adventure can result in your becoming self-indulgent and totally unaware of the feelings of those around you. In the worse case situations negative 5's are very undependable and self-serving.", 6, "The Life Path 6 indicates that very prominent in your nature is a strong sense of responsibility. You are idealistic and must feel useful to be happy. The main contribution you make is that of advice, service and ever present support. This is the Life Path related to leadership by example and assumption of responsibility, thus, it is your obligation to pick up the burden and always be ready to help. The Life Path 6 is one who is compelled to function with strength and compassion, a sympathetic and kind person, generous with personal and material resources. Wisdom, balance, and understanding are the cornerstones of this Life Path. Your extraordinary wisdom and the ability to understand the problems of others is apt to commence from an early age allowing you to easily span the generation gap and assume an important role in life early on. While the 6 may assume huge responsibilities in the community, the life revolves around the immediate home and family, for this is the most domestic of numbers. Most with Life Path 6 are the positive types who willingly carry far more than their fair share of the load and are always there when needed. You are very human and realistic about life, and you feel that the most important thing in your life is the home, family and friends.\nThe number 6 Life Path actually produces few negative examples, but there are some pitfalls peculiar to the path. Avoid a tendency to become overwhelmed by responsibilities and a slave to others. Also, avoid being too critical (of yourself or of others). The misuse of this Life Path produces tendencies towards exaggeration, over-expansiveness, and self-righteousness. Imposing one's views in an interfering or meddling way must be an issue of concern. The natural burdens of this number are heavy, and on rare occasions, responsibility is abdicated by persons with this Life Path 6. This rejection of responsibility will make you feel very guilty and uneasy, and it will have very damaging effects upon your relationships with others.", 7, "A Life Path 7 person is a peaceful and affectionate soul, and by nature rather reserved and analytical. The overwhelming strength of the number 7 is reflected in the depth of thinking that is shown; you will garner knowledge from practically every source that you find. Intellectual, scientific and studious, you don't accept a premise until you have dissected the subject and arrived at you own independent conclusion. This is a very spiritual number and it often denotes a sort of spiritual wisdom that becomes apparent at a fairly early age. You need a good deal of quiet time to be with your own inner thoughts and dreams. You dislike crowds, noise and confusion. You are very thorough and complete in your work, the perfectionist who expects everyone else to be a meet a high standard of performance, too. You evaluate situations very quickly and with amazing accuracy. You rely heavily on your experiences and your intuition, rather than accepting advice from someone; your hunches usually prove to be very accurate, and knowing this, you are one who tends to follow the directions they seem to guide. It's easy for you to detect deception and recognize insincere people. You aren't one to have a wide circle of friends, but once you accept someone as a friend, it's for life. You really aren't a very social person, and your reserve is often taken to be aloofness. Actually, it's not that at all, but merely a cover up for your basic feeling of insecurity. You actually like being alone, away from the hustle and bustle of modern life. In many ways, you would have fit in better in much earlier times when the pace of life was less hectic.\nIn the most negative use of the 7 energies, you can become very pessimistic, lackadaisical, quarrelsome, and secretive. A Life Path 7 individual who is not living life fully and gaining through experiences, is a hard person to live with because of a serious lack of consideration and because there is such a negative attitude. The negative 7 is very selfish and spoiled. If you have any of the negative traits they are very difficult to get rid of because you tend to feel that the world really does owe you a living or in some way is not being fairly treated. Fortunately, the negative 7 is not the typical 7, at least not without some mitigating positive traits. This number is one that seems to have some major shifts from highs to lows. Stability in feelings may be elusive for you.", 8, "With the Life Path of the number 8 you are focused on learning the satisfactions to be found in the material world. The Life Path 8 produces many powerful, confident and materially successful people. You are apt to be very independent, forceful and competitive. Your routine is involved in practical, down-to-earth affairs, and there is relatively little time for dreams and visions. You will want to use your ambitions, your organizational ability, and your efficient approach to carve a satisfying niche for yourself. Most of your concerns involve money and learning of the power that comes with its proper manipulation. This Life Path is perhaps the one that is the most concerned with and desirous of status, as an accompaniment to material success. If you are a positive 8 you are endowed with tremendous potential for conceiving far-reaching schemes and ideas, and also possessing the tenacity and independence to follow them through to completion. In short, you are well-equipped for competition in the business world or in other competitive fields of endeavor. You know how to manage yourself and your environment. You are practical and steady in your pursuit of major objectives, and you have the courage of your convictions when it comes to taking the necessary chances to get ahead.\nThe negative 8 can be dictatorial and often suppresses the enthusiasm and efforts of fellow member of the environment. Often, the strength of their own personality excludes close feelings for other people with whom they come in contact. Material gains and rewards often become issues of utmost importance, even to the neglect of family, home and peace of mind. Dedication to success can become an obsession. Emotional feelings are often suppressed by the negative 8, resulting in isolation and loneliness. All Life Path 8 people must avoid discounting the opinions of others.", 9, "The keys to the nature of a Life Path number 9 person are compassion, generosity, and a very humanitarian attitude. This is the lesson that must be learned in this life. Usually this number produces an individual that is very trustworthy and honorable, and one unlikely to harbor any sort of prejudice. Obviously, this is a rather tall order, but you are, in fact, a person that feels very deeply for individuals less fortunate than yourself, and if you are in a position to help, you certainly will. You tend to be quite sensitive, as you see the world with much feeling and compassion. The 9, being the highest of the single digit numbers, holds an elevated position and poses certain responsibilities. The purpose of life for those with a 9 life path is of a philosophical nature. Judges, spiritual leaders, healers and educators frequently have much 9 energy. Material gains are not overly important, although the quality of some life path 9 people is such that they are materially rewarded in very significant ways. Often, the number 9 life path requires a very selfless attitude and the giving up of material possessions for the common good. Even the very average of those with life path 9 possess extremely compassionate tendencies. The desire to help others, especially the troubled or underprivileged, is strong. You are apt to frequently find yourself being used and let down by others, as your generosity is misused and abused.\nThe number 9's very deep understanding of life is sometimes manifested in the artistic and literary fields. Here you may be able to express your deep emotional feelings through painting, writing, music, or other art forms. Often, however, there if a great deal of difficulty finding a suitable outlet for the 9 Life Path. The 9 is usually well suited to the helping and healing professions; the number is less inclined to the competitive business environment.\n\nYou have the ability to make friends very easily, as people are attracted to your magnetic, open personality. You have a special gift of understanding people, which if used correctly can be of great benefit to others. Your interest in people tends to make you quite social. People just naturally like you because you are so sympathetic, tolerant and broadminded. In many ways, you are a romantic that can get lost in your loves and passions. Relationships can be difficult for you, however, because it is hard to strike a balance that will work effectively. If your partner is one sharing your giving attitudes, the relationship will be happy and lasting, but materially very difficult. On the other hand, if you choose a down-to-earth, materially conscious individual, problems will arise quickly.\n\nAs do all the life path numbers, the 9 has its negative side, and because of the demanding nature of the truly positive 9, many tend to fail in this category. It is not uncommon for persons with the 9 life path to fight the realities and challenges of purpose imposed here because selflessness is not an easy trait. You may have difficulty believing that giving and a lack of personal ambition can be satisfying. It must be realized and accepted that little long-term satisfaction and happiness is to be gained by rejecting the natural humanitarian inclinations of this path.", 11, "The number 11 Life Path has the connotation of illumination describing its general focus. This is the number associated with spiritual awareness. As one of the two master numbers, 11 vibrations yield understanding and knowledge beyond the grasp of others. The attitude toward life of those possessing this Life Path is somewhat extreme; extremely intuitive, avant-garde, idealistic, visionary, and cultured. These extremes make you an interesting, if unusual person, with much to offer society. The Life Path 11 person is deep-thinking, and you are no doubt interested in understanding many of life's mysteries and more intriguing facets. Your inventive mind and broadminded views will permit you to succeed in life in any number of ventures. You can best serve society, however, in those endeavors utilizing your skills of counseling and guidance. Much of your idealism is people oriented and quite humanitarian in nature. You expect a great deal of yourself and of those to whom you are close.\nOn the negative side, there is a lot of nervous tension associated with the 11 life path, and you can be a difficult person to deal with because of this. For this reason, relationships, at times, can be difficult. This is a Life Path that seems to feature broad mood swings between the elation and depression. You are likely to have trouble making decisions and getting your life in gear, so to speak. There is a tendency for the 11 to harbor feelings of uneasiness, and dissatisfaction with accomplishments and personal progress in life. Your grandiose schemes usually make sense, but you can get off the track and they can be very impractical. You have a very distinct side that lacks common sense, and you are quite often unable to distinguish between fantasy and reality. In this regard, you are perhaps more of a dreamer than a doer. When you do get on target, your ideas seem to have been inspired on high. Perhaps you are not a leader, but you are a visionary and a very talented idea person.", 22, "The Life Path 22 is the higher of the two master number, and the most powerful of all the Life Path numbers. As such, it is also the most difficult to live up to and fulfill. The 22 individual in endowed with many powers from within and they can reach any heights in life. A truly positive Life Path 22 person, equipped with a suitable education, can be a master builder in society. An idealistic nature is grounded in practical terms, allowing you to conceive grandiose, far-reaching schemes and carry them through to the end. If you desire and are willing to work for it, you can achieve enormous success, prestige, and fame. Obviously, everyone with this Life Path does not become famous, but you may have realized early in life that you have the capacity to accomplish a great deal with relatively little effort.\nSeveral Life Path number possess special spiritual understanding, however, the 22 is unique in that this path has great understanding, but also the ability to apply knowledge in a practical way. There is purpose to your life and you view your tasks and obligations in a very emotionally controlled and determined way.\n\nReally negative 22 people are very rare. When they do show up, there power is similar to positive 22, but motivations are in a negative vein and they are very dictatorial, insensitive, and overbearing. The majority of 22 people fall into an average category who still have sufficient ability to reach great heights within their chosen fields. The ability to control emotion may help in the business world. This is a powerful Life Path, both for the material gain it can bring and for the higher good that is often achieved for mankind.");

%expression = (1, "A number 1 Expression denotes the skilled executive with keen administrative capabilities. You must develop the capacity to be a fine leader, sales executive, or promoter. You have the tools to become an original person with a creative approach to problem solving, and a penchant for initiating action. Someone may have to follow behind you to handle the details, but you know how to get things going and make things happen. You have a good mind and the ability to use it for your advancement.

You fear routine and being in a rut. You often jump the gun because you are afraid of being left behind.\n\nThe negative attributes of the 1 Expression are egotism and a self-centered approach to life. This is an aggressive number and if it is over-emphasized it is very hard to live with. You do not have to be overly aggressive to fulfill your destiny. The 1 has a natural instinct to dominate and to be the boss; adhering to the concept of being number One.  Again, you do not have to dominate and destroy in order to lead and manage.", 2, "A number 2 Expression gives you the tools to work very well with other people. Your destiny is in the role of the mediator and the peacemaker. In many ways you are dependent on others and seem to function best in a partnership or in some form of group activity. Modesty runs deep in your nature, and you can work comfortably without recognition of your accomplishments. Often, others get credit for your ideas, and this is of little real concern to your since you are such a willing team player. As you grow in this direction, you become sensitive to the feelings of others, you are ever diplomatic in handling complicated situations. Cooperative, courteous, and considerate, you have the capacity to become an outstanding facilitator.  You know how to organize and handle people. You are a good detail person because you rarely overlook anything. Tactful and friendly, nearly everyone likes you.\nThe negative 2 personality can be over-sensitive and easily hurt. Too much of this number in your makeup can make you very shy and uncertain. Sometimes the excessive 2 energies makes one apathetic and somewhat indifferent to the job at hand; the ability to handle details is hampered in these cases.", 3, "An Expression of 3 produces a quest for destiny with words along a variety of lines that may include writing, speaking, singing, acting or teaching; our entertainers, writers, litigators, teachers, salesmen, and composers. You also have the destiny to sell yourself or sell just about any product that comes along.

%periods = (1, "1 Life Path Period\n\nEarly years: In this period you will show a stronger tendency toward independence. Originality and creativity come early and continue through this period. You have the ability to lead early on, but at a time when the emphasis is on learning to follow, this can be a problem. You do have a good deal of early self-confidence and individuality which can help you achieve early successes. You are aggressive in your early career path.\n\nProductive years: In this period you will have more drive and determination thanks to the 1 life path period. If you have other indicators that you would do well in business for yourself, this life path period would be time to move in that direction. Your demeanor now is highly independent and leadership skills are sharpened. The potential pitfalls here are letting ego go a little out of control and perhaps showing a lack of patience at times.\n\nLater years: New challenges may continue to appear even in your later years. In this period you may achieve the recognition that eluded you earlier, and this may mean it will be hard to kick back and take life easy. A 1 life path period does not lend itself to early retirement and leisure activities. Indeed, this may become the most active time of your life.", 2, "2 Life Path Period\n\nEarly years: This is a difficult life path period for a young child since it suggests that emotions may run high and sensitivities to many things may be present. On the positive side, this influence may be helpful for developing any artistic talents. The 2 period may be one in which you will be required to be helpful, supportive, and willing to adapt in general. A tendency to have emotional reactions to problems and confrontation may follow you into early adulthood.\n\nProductive years: The 2 lifepath period suggests that you will profit from your ability to work together with others in harmony and cooperation. In these years your ability to use skills in diplomacy and mediation will be pronounced. The affairs of others and their success may be the key to your own advancement. Pushing your own agenda doesn't work as well now. The need is to control hyperactive emotions that may appear from time to time.\n\nLater years: The 2 lifepath period in the later years promises a good retirement with many friends and opportunities. Your influence now will be based on your ability to bring together diverse opinions and ideas. Friends and family, and especially a close relationship is all important to your happiness now. Having close connections is vital to your health and wellbeing in your senior years.", 3, "3 Life Path Period\n\nEarly years: The 3 is an excellent lifepath period for a young person because of its inclination toward the development of expression. Any talents you may have in creative or artistic endeavors are encouraged during this period. Emotions may be high and hyperactive tendencies can be present. Making friends and enjoying social interactions will come easily now. Enjoy life as this is the tone of the 3 period, but be careful not to scatter your activities to the point that you fail to make progress on anything.\n\nProductive years: This is likely to be a very pleasant, carefree and creative time in your life. Being original and using your talents of expression will find you furthering your career and your life in general. If there is a pitfall during this time it is becoming overly optimistic and extravagant, and spreading your talents too thin. In all this is a period that offers much happiness in exchange for a minimum of planning and concentration.\n\nLater years: A 3 period in later life suggests an active social life with numerous hobbies and activities. If you are a creative person, this late life period may become your most prolific and fruitful. Indeed, this may be the time to write that book you have thought about, a time to learn a new method of expression perhaps, or simply let your imagination run free. Enjoy yourself, it won't be that terribly hard now.", 4, "4 Life Path Period\n\nEarly years: A 4 life path period is not much fun for a young person. It suggests that learning is difficult or the demands placed upon you to learn were harsh and burdensome. Now you have to build a solid foundation and the tone is one of learning practicality, order, and routine. Often this period denotes growing up with limited resources or restrictions of some sort. The demands often set the stage for later successes. You are to be very well prepared to start your career in early adulthood.\n\nProductive years: This period is a time to build and develop ideas into a tactile form. Now is a time that you become more of a builder, a better organizer, and perhaps even a more stable and secure person. Your judgment and decisions take on more conservatism and practicality, and they are based on careful and more thoughtful planning. You are apt to be more serious about your work and perhaps devote more time to it, too. Be careful not to become a workaholic. With a 4 lifepath period you must be constantly reminded to take the time to smell the roses.\n\nLater years: The 4 period in the later years suggests a period that predicts work rather than retirement. Whether by choice or by necessity, you are apt to keep your nose to the grindstone a lot longer than most of your peers. Even if you do retire, you will want to keep working on hobbies and avocation long after others have opted for the rocking chair. If you own your own business, it may be hard to accept that fact that things can run without your ever present attention.", 5, "5 Life Path Period\n\nEarly years: The 5 period early in life can be difficult because it often lacks the stability and certainty that you may wish for. This period often features changes and emphases freedom of thought and activity. You are likely to be constantly looking for something new, something exciting, something less boring to stimulate your expansive mind. During this time you will be an explorer and a wanderer. Whether this is a positive or a negative trait only time will tell. At any rate you are driven by curiosity and adventure. A restless nature often results, and as you progress into adulthood, a number of job or career changes may occur.\n\nProductive years: In this period you are ever ready to accept change, progress, and new ideas. Likewise you are quick, some times too quick, to dump the old, old jobs, old activities, even old relationships. Sometimes this is good, sometime not so good. At any rate this 5 period suggests that you are more impulsive now and the test will be to see if you can handle the increased freedom you are feeling with constructive judgment. If so, you will find this is a period that can and should produce remarkable results.\n\nLater years: With the 5 period occurring late in life, be prepared for a never ending series of adventures and expansive travel so long as the resources hold out. Actually, however, many with a late life 5 period choose to continue to work because of the sense of freedom found in their endeavors now; so long as the work is not boring or routine, there may be no reason to quit. This influence will continue to send you off to find new challenges and try new things. You are never too old to learn.", 6, "6 Life Path Period\n\nEarly years: The 6 period produces a need to be needed, and you probably want to help your parents or your brothers, sisters, and friends in whatever way you can. In some cases, this period is one in which the subject is required or somehow forced to take on more than a normal amount of responsibility at an early age. Generally, this early time in the life is marked by obvious attempts to be helpful and even nurturing to others. In early adulthood there is a strong sense of responsibility and caring.\n\nProductive years: Through these years you will find yourself getting ahead only after you have made the personal sacrifices necessary to benefit others in need. Much of your life in this period will tend to be centered around your home and family. This is not a period that lends itself to dramatic enrichment because you tend to be more selfless and less demanding of personal rewards. Your opportunities may be as an idealist, a mediator, and perhaps even a leader in your community. Certainly the focus of the period is associated with family and domestic concerns.\n\nLater years: The 6 period late in life is usually a happy and content time. It denotes a tendency to accept responsibility and lend a helping hand to those around you. You are not likely to be lonely in your later years since family and domestic matters will probably be emphasized during this time. Indeed, you may help or even be responsible for rearing a grandchild or two.", 7, "7 Life Path Period\n\nEarly years: If there is a problem with the 7 period in early life it is being misunderstood or considered \"difficult.\" In this period you may have the sense that you are different from your peers. You repel conformity. The 7 period makes you inclined to seek and absorb learning as a primary focus. The fact that you don't feel very comfortable in your environment is to be expected. Your natural curiosity and inquisitive mind will take you far during this period.\n\nProductive years: The 7 period in the productive years is excellent for one continuing studies and analysis into mid life. The tendency is to strive for mental growth and development and you are apt to be in the process of expanding your areas of interest now. This period is a plus if you are engaged in academic pursuits, but otherwise progress may be slow. It is hard to force yourself to seek opportunity now, and if you do, it will probably be to no avail. Perhaps it will come to you if you get prepared.\n\nLater years: When the 7 period occurs in later life you may find yourself engaged in study as never before in your life. This period may find you writing more, engaged in some form of research, or venturing into new and interesting subjects. This is not a very social period and indeed there is concern that you may become increasingly isolated by your own choosing.", 8, "8 Life Path Period\n\nEarly years: An 8 period in early life stresses the practical and the material. This is not the stuff of a good childhood experience as it may tend to elevate the importance of material success at an inappropriate age. For the less affluent, there may be too much interest in achieving material goals. This period may have its positive side in preparing a relatively young person for financial and material success. You may go into business early in life with the tools to succeed.\n\nProductive years: The 8 lifepath period in the productive years may push you to a level of success that would not have otherwise been attained. This period denotes a time when attainment, authority, and general business acumen is brought to foreground. You will want to set your goals high and do everything in a big way. If you have the inherent management abilities, this period will accelerate your prestige and attainments.\n\nLater years: With the 8 lifepath period in later life, it is suggested that your greatest achievements may be yet to come. If all you have lacked before is good management, now may be your time to shine. In retirement you may find yourself deeply involved in clubs, organizations and perhaps government entities. Your contribution to these can be important for your sense of accomplishment and for your social life at this time.", 9, "9 Life Path Period\n\nEarly years: The 9 lifepath is difficult for a young person because so much is expected of them in terms of feeling compassion and tolerance. The youthful years are by nature selfish years and the 9 period stifles this sense of being self absorbed. While the upbringing under this influence can be helpful in the future, often the period brings periods of feeling lonely, unappreciated and unsure of self. The lesson of the 9 is that life is universal rather than personal, and thus, those with this early path may have a head start.\n\nProductive years: With the 9 in the productive years you may find yourself becoming more of a humanitarian. You may find it easier to express compassion, sympathy, understanding and tolerance while in this period. This can be an emotional cycle and one of significant personal growth. You may be called on to overcome disappointments and setbacks, but the potential for gain in this period is significant.\n\nLater years: The 9 period in the later years generally signifies a settled and happy life at this juncture. You are inclined to positive feelings toward the world, and you will want to share your experiences to a greater extent. You may engage in many positive works benefiting mankind or just a few needy souls in your immediate environment. The lesson of the number is learning to give without expecting to get something back. If you have learned this by this time, this period may well be the best part of your life.", 11, "11 Life Path Period\n\nEarly years: This master number is generally not attainable by a very young person and it is usually best to consider this a 2 lifepath period early on. As a young adult, you may find yourself drawn toward spiritual matters and idealism. Indeed, in this period you are inclined to act as an idealist, perhaps studying religion, metaphysics, or philosophy. Modest goals during this period will serve you best, as being too aggressive will result in problems with stress and nerves.\n\nProductive years: In the productive years the 11 lifepath period will serve you best in any spiritual pursuit, but you may find yourself being a little out of touch with the business world. If your life has been a material one up to now, this period may cause some redirection. If you have inclinations to teach, to heal, to uplift, this is period when these lofty goals can come to fruit. This period can be a hard one if you find yourself under pressure and stress. Nervous tension can be a periodic problem.\n\nLater years: In retirement or at least the later years, the 11 lifepath period may direct you toward a more spiritual conclusion. In these years you will be able to find more time for study and reflection, expanding your mind and broadening your thinking. This redirection may push you into a more spiritual way of thinking and definitely away from the material side of life. For some who reject the idea of spiritualism, the \"Later years 2\" reading may be more definitive.", 22, "22 Life Path Period\n\nEarly years: There is no early 22 lifepath period since there is no 22 month.\n\nProductive years: The 22 period during the productive years can send you sailing up the ladder. If you are properly prepared and adequately equipped, this period may find you being placed in charge of big projects, accomplishing huge achievements, and functioning or striving for a spot at the top of the heap. The number 22 is the master builder. Having the period doesn't necessarily make you a master builder, but it does produce the flow of events that will certainly speed you on the road to success. This is a time to follow your hunches as you assume greater responsibility and capitalize on opportunities. Keep nerves and emotions under control as these can be a problem during this period.\n\nLater years: Many with the 22 period in later life never do retire or if they do, that retirement is never one that is complete leisure. Nervous energy may keep you on the go. This period may well be your most accomplished as events of the time may indeed set you up for big projects and major achievements. Keep occupied in these years and don't shy away from the main stage of life.");

The challenge of the number 1 is avoidance of being dominated, but doing so in a fashion that does not impose upon or dominate others. With the challenge of the number 1 it's extremely important to control the ego, and avoid the negative aspect of individuality. False pride, pomposity, egotism are issues to be guarded against now.

Used more positively, your keen sensitivities can be a significant strength, allowing you to be acutely aware of so much of with others rarely perceive. But during this period it will be hard for you to assert yourself and make decisions. You will shy away from positions of authority and responsibility. This can be a time for accumulation of wisdom, as you show patience and pay close attention to detail. Try not to take things too personally. Friendships are a source of deep satisfaction to you during this time. Respect your ability to compromise and grow in a quiet way. Do not let details overwhelm you and keep you from seeing the big picture.

Though you know you should cultivate friends and be sociable, you tend to be somewhat reclusive and defensive. You may have a talent for writing, acting, or speaking, but you are reluctant to involve yourself with these sorts of activities because you do not like to face the prospects of criticism. You are expressing yourself with a negative emphasis, hiding your creative talents behind a wall of shyness. You must strive to develop yourself in a social and in a creative sense.

Change may be necessary for you, but it must be handled in an intelligent and controlled manner. Make certain that the desire for change is not associated with a desire to escape responsibility. In any event, this challenge requires that you learn as early as possible in life to control your impulses.", 6, "Challenge 6\n\nThe challenge of the number 6 suggests that you may have difficulties because of your insistence on extremely high standards. You are apt to appear authoritarian, intolerant, and a little self-righteous. It is hard for others to live up to your standards of expectation.

This will be a period that will bring the opportunity for marked increase in your personal status and recognition.

One thing may lead to another and you may find many alterations in your life during this essence.\nIf this essence remains in effect for 3 years or more...\n\nBecause this Essence is in effect for such a long period of time, its meaning with regard to change is somewhat confusing.

Challenges and changes will mark this part of your life. Responsibilities and accomplishments will be based on the ability to lead, direct, and express your own individuality and original ideas.", 2, "Fourth Pinnacle...2\nThis latter part of your life should be harmonious whether you are retired or continue to work. The key to fulfillment will be patience, tact, and cooperation, and you will find it necessary to control a tendency toward sensitivity.", 3, "4th Pinnacle...3\nThere is a good possibility of much travel, social activity and entertainment. This transit usually promises freedom from financial worry in the later years. While there is a tendency to drift in relative comfort, this is a time when you can be at your creative best.", 4, "4th Pinnacle...4\nWith the number 4 fourth pinnacle, any desire to retire or slow down is not likely to be fulfilled. You are not the type to relax and enjoy leisure activities. It is important to work and feel the sense of accomplishment. In some unfortunate cases, economic conditions retard the ability to retire and enjoy life.", 5, "Fourth Pinnacle...5\nWith the fourth pinnacle showing 5, any desire to retire or slow down is not likely to be fulfilled. Change and variety will continue to keep your occupied and busy. If you are adaptable, this can be a very interesting time in your life. In most cases, a final pinnacle of 5 means freedom from financial or domestic worries.", 6, "Fourth Pinnacle...6\nAs a last pinnacle, the 6 brings home the rewards and pleasures of family, security, and a close circle of friends. You are likely to find yourself giving back some of the nurturing and attention that you received in the early part of your life.", 7, "Fourth Pinnacle...7\nWith a number 7 fourth pinnacle, your later years will be a quiet time when you will be chiefly involved with the development and refinement of your inner being. This is a time for study, development, and thinking about life in philosophical ways. During this period it may not be easy for you to find individuals with whom you truly feel comfortable unless your spouse has similar attitudes. Be patient for people will come to you for what you know.", 8, "Fourth Pinnacle...8\nWith the number 8 fourth pinnacle, business and position will make retirement at the normal age unlikely. Circumstances in the later years may be an atmosphere of status and power.", 9, "Fourth Pinnacle...9\nWith the fourth pinnacle showing the number 9, your work in the latter part of life will tend to be more philanthropic, allowing you to give much more of yourself, and if your financial circumstances permit, your assets, to causes that benefit mankind. Certainly, you have a more caring attitude now than in earlier times of your life.", 11, "Fourth Pinnacle...11\nWith the 11 pinnacle occurring in the fourth stage of your life, your responsibilities and accomplishments of significance will contain the tone of the inspirational nature of this number, and it is probable that your work later in life or your retirement years will carry this influence.", 22, "Fourth Pinnacle...22\nIf you have the capacity to achieve the statue of master builder forecast by this pinnacle, business endeavors with idealistic ends will likely preclude retirement.");

%tendencies = (1, "Creative/Inspired tendencies\nThe concept of creative letters is synonymous with movement, or the nature of letters giving movement or action to the nature. This suggests that you are a person who is inclined toward constant activity, with efforts directed at the here and now. You are ambitious and ready to go after whatever it is you want without hesitation. You are likely to act immediately on issues that come to your attention, never sitting idly by waiting for someone else to get things started. Positively expressed, creative letters produce constructive initiative. Yet sometimes they produce thoughtless actions that gain little.", 2, "Adaptable Tendencies\nThe tendencies of Adaptable letters in your chart denotes flexibility, and you may be so changeable that it is almost impossible to pin you down. You have the ability to go off in several directions at the same time, and it can be difficult focusing your attention to one thing for very long. You are able to fit easily into most situations. You adapt yourself to all sorts of experiences in life, and like a chameleon, you are able to adjust. Personal and sentimental, you are concerned with people rather than ideals or personal ambitions. You have an inner desire for much personal freedom, though you may find decision-making and self-directed actions difficult. You learn from the past, and in fact, you may occasionally dwell in the past rather than concentrating on the future. You're flexible and ingenious in emergencies because of your innate ability to improvise.", 3, "Grounded Tendencies\nThe strength in the Grounded letters in your chart suggests that you hold to fixed or rigid ideals and goals. What you may lack in daring, you make up for in perseverance. You are usually able to achieve whatever you undertake, purely from the strength of your determination. You are extremely strong-willed and resistant to external influences. You set values and ideals over individuals and situations, sometimes in an uncompromising manner. Your great strengths are loyalty, constancy and dependability. The down side of a Grounded chart is the likelihood of too much of a fixed or stubborn nature. Compromise is hard for you because giving in is nearly impossible. You may be so rigid that you can't roll with the punches.", 4, "Creative/Adaptable\nThe combination of most of the letters in the creative and Adaptable mode suggests that you are a person who is inclined toward constant activity, but this activity must provide variety and change. Your efforts are directed at the here and now, but decision-making can sometimes be a problem. You are likely to act immediately on issues that come to your attention, but not without paying attention to the lessons from the past. Sometimes, you may dwell on the past a little too long. Positively expressed, creative letters produce constructive initiative, while the Adaptable tone allows you to always be flexible. You are able to fit easily into most situations, and you produce results wherever you fit in. You are devoted rather than ambitious.", 5, "Creative/Grounded tendencies\nThe combination of most of the letters in the creative and Grounded mode suggests that you are a person who is inclined toward constant activity, while holding firmly to your views and convictions. Your efforts are directed at the here and now, and you are usually able to achieve whatever it is you undertake purely from the strength of your determination. You are ambitious rather than adaptable, strong-willed and resistant to external influences, and yet always ready for the next challenge. You set values and ideals high, and attainment is a constant goal. The creative influences may make you charge off in many different directions and the Grounded letters will want to finish everything that you start. So, you are the type of person that is apt to overload and over-extend yourself.", 6, "Grounded/Adaptable\nThe combination of most of the letters in the Grounded and Adaptable modes produce certain conflicts in your nature. Although these two approaches are quite different and contradictory, you are apt to express both; a rigid and unyielding, persistent and determined Grounded approach, but with the ability to adapt, change, and work around obstacles when it becomes clear that flexibility is the only way to win. Your freedom is extremely important to you because you're set in your ways. You plan mediation give and take carefully, and often win in negotiations.", 7, "The Letters in your Name are Balanced\nSince the modes of the letters in your name are so well balanced, you have enough of the creative influence to get a project going; enough of the Grounded influence to stay on track and get the job done; enough of the Adaptable mode to generally be flexible and accept change when necessary. Well, maybe you're not quite perfect, but having a good balance is helpful in many ways.");

%absence = (0, '', 1, "\n\nNo Creative Letters in the Name\nA lack of creative letters suggests a lack in initiative and drive unless these attributes are shown elsewhere in the core elements. Not one to pursue desires actively, you sometimes look to others to satisfy them for you. You wait for opportunities rather than forcing the issue and making your own breaks.", 2, "\n\nAdaptable Absence\nYour chart is nearly void of letters in the Adaptable mode suggesting that you may have difficulties with changes in your life. You are very cautious about trying new things and prefer to remain loyal to the status quo. Because changes threaten you, you may stay stuck in a rut. Your inflexibility isn't necessarily due to stubbornness or ego (although both may contribute in this case), but stems instead from a desire to maintain order and stability in your life.", 3, "\n\nGrounded Absence\nBecause your chart is void or nearly void in Grounded letters, you may be better at starting things than finishing them. Either you become bored with something soon after beginning it, or you take on so much that you don't have the energy or focus to accomplish anything. You may have difficulty in various aspects of your life, frequently changing jobs, lovers, residences, and even your beliefs and ideas on many of life's weightier issues.");

%mtemp = (1, "Weak: Your name suggests that mental assertiveness is not paramount in your makeup. No matter how strong your intellect may be, you have trouble giving way to cold logic, facts and pure reasoning arguments. It may be hard for you to stay interested and motivated in mental disciplines. With limitations here, you may shun the idea of taking charge and calling all of the shots. You act on feel and experience, rarely stopping long enough to think things through carefully. Your hunches may take you further than others relying on proof.", 2, "Average: Your name shows substantial strength in the mental plane suggesting that you have the ability to think things through carefully before making a decision. You have little difficulty handling mental activities even when they become technical and complex. You are comfortable in a leadership role, but this may not necessarily be an essential to your well-being.", 3, "Strong: The mental plane is very strong in your makeup. You have a serious concern with logic, reason and precise fact-finding. Your motivating force is logic and hunches without the backup of a multitude of facts and figures won't get far in your world. You are likely to make a very strong leader in whatever competitive field you select. Your reasoning power may compete with the best in your environment.");

%ptemp = (1, "Weak: Your name suggests that physical or material interests are not paramount in your makeup. You would never pride yourself as being a very practical person. Indeed, your behavior may be anything but realistic and you really don't care. You may actually lack a solid sense of physical discipline and tend to avoid tedious and repetitive work when you can. It's hard for you to turn your many ideas into hard reality. Playing the game and competing at any significant level may be foreign to your nature.", 2, "Average: You are essentially a common sense person with a concern for the practical and the economical use of resources and assets. You have the ability to stick with a job and get it done even if it is not all fun and games. You have a healthy competitive spirit which serves you well without going overboard. Your ability to concentrate on the task at hand is solidly set in your nature.", 3, "Strong: The physical plane is very strong in your makeup. Practicality rules in your life and you focus your energies forcefully on the task at hand no matter how trying it may be. You have amazing endurance and your systematic approach suggests that you are a potential master builder. Your economical sense of values is hardly ever surpassed. Rarely does anyone work harder or accomplishes more than you.");

%etemp = (1, "Weak: Your name suggests that the emotional or feeling interests are not paramount in your makeup. This is not to suggest that you don't care about others, but you have some difficulty expressing your feelings or understanding the feelings of others in your environment. Indeed, you may have difficulty understanding and accepting your own emotional nature. Because of this, you don't express your emotions effectively and you may come off as being somewhat unsentimental.", 2, "Average: You have a healthy sense of sentiment and feeling. You rarely have difficulty expressing yourself emotionally, and you are reasonably well tuned into the emotions of those around you. Your emotional plane is strong enough to give you talents in originality and creativity, and you can occasionally impress with your artistic skills.", 3, "Strong: The emotional plane is very strong in your makeup. Indeed, your point of view usually contains significant portions of emotion and imagination without much concern for the facts of the matter. It's easy for you to get carried away sometimes. You are very original and creative and you care deeply for causes you embrace. You are extremely sentimental, sympathetic and caring. Your direct expression of friendship, affections and love make it clear where you stand.");

%itemp = (1, "Weak: Your name suggests that intuitional or spiritual interests are not paramount in your makeup. So called intuitive awareness, psychic or otherwise spiritual matters aren't of much interest to you as you go about your daily tasks. The idea of developing inwardly pretty much leaves you cold. If there is an inner voice, you don't have much trust in it.", 2, "Average: You have a healthy respect for and belief in things that are outside of what you can know and feel. You are able to accept ideas of religion, spiritual development, and the metaphysical. You seek development inwardly as a worthwhile part of your life.", 3, "Strong: The intuitional plane is very strong in your makeup. You have a deep concern for the spiritual, metaphysical, and/or philosophical issues in life. You may often listen to an inner voice providing spiritual guidance and direction. You may be psychically inclined. Your approach to the brotherhood of man is compassionate and tolerant. Gaining spiritual wisdom is a major concern.");
